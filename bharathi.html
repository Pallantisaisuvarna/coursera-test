    <h1>What Kind of Rice Do I Need to Make Chicken Biryani? </h1>
    <p>There are many, many different kinds of Biryani, all specific to various regions, each with their own ingredient and cooking method variations.  Turkey, Iran and South Asia all have their own variations and India alone has at least a dozen different versions of Biryani.   But whether it’s made with chicken, mutton, fish or vegetables, and whatever other ingredients may or may not be included, every biryani has one ingredient in common:  Rice.  And the most commonly used rice for biryani is basmati rice.<br>Basmati rice is unique from other types of rice.  With its attractively long and slender grains, it’s delicious flavor, wonderfully fragrant aroma (basmati is from the Sanskrit word meaning “fragrant”) and its perfect texture, basmati rice remains one of the most preferred kinds of rice among chefs worldwide.<br>Basmati rice is lighter and fluffier than regular rice and doesn’t stick together and it’s this latter characteristic in particular that is essential to achieving the perfect biryani.
    </p>
    <h1>How to Prepare the Basmati Rice</h1>
    <p>Any sources for traditional biryani will emphasize the importance of cooking the rice just right.   This isn’t difficult to achieve, you just have to know how to do it.  In order for biryani to have the right texture, basmati rice has to be thoroughly washed and then soaked for at least 20-30 minutes before cooking it.  And then it must be parboiled, meaning it’s cooked only three-fourths of the way so that it’s still slightly “al dente”.  The rest of its brief cooking time takes place with the meat.<br>With the right rice in hand all you need to make chicken biryani is some chicken, yogurt, onions, garlic, ginger, curry powder, cinnamon, raisins, almonds, chicken broth and cilantro.   And with those ingredients you’ll get a vibrantly flavorful and wholesome meal that your whole family will enjoy.
